### Instructions for use

Download this file as a zip archive and then unzip it using 7-zip, WinZip, or a similar program to extract the .pk3 file to be used with modern launchers and ports.

A Doom launcher must be used to load the doom or doom 2 wad, the brutalv21.pk3, and this expansion on modern ports.  Dragging and dropping on the port's .exe will only work for a single file and this expansion requires loading two files.

### Load-Order

- Doom.wad or Doom2.wad
- any map-only wads
- brutalv21.pk3
- brutalv21expansion.pk3
- music wads and any files that are not going to rewrite files already modified by the bd21expansion.pk3 unless specificaly developed with the bdexpansion in-mind or else you risk conflicts and unforseen errors.
