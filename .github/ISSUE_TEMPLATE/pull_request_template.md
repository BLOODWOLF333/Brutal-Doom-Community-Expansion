### Title
Brief title relating to your pull request's subject matter.

### Description
Brief summary of what your pull request adds or fixes and the files changed.

### Standardization
- Please keep pull request as single-issue items (fix or add one feature at a time).  Which will require us to make a branch of our fork for each issue addressed to keep things organzied.
- Update the ExpansionChangelog with your PR.  Including adding your name to Authored by: if it is not already.
- Retain the original structure of how the files are ordered in the brutalv21.pk3 (As in, keep the files you are modifying under their original marker and order among the rest of the files the way Mark laid it out unless the restructure is specifically to fix an issue or you are adding a new file).
