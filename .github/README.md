### Instructions for use

Go to the Releases tab for the latest (zipped-up) Stable or Development Snapshot pk3.  Otherwise these files must be downloaded, the github-specific files deleted, and then using 7zip or another archive tool, zipped up and saved with the .pk3 extension to get the very latest build of the project.

I recommend using a Doom launcher program to place all the files in the correct order for play.  Else you will have to write a .bat file or select (in correct order), drag, and drop them all onto your port's executable.

### What has changed:

- A new crueltybonus system with red health and armor bonus drops
- Upgraded vehicle HUD's including a turret-to-tracks orientation indicator for tanks, and a vertical scrolling pitchladder for the helicopter
- The motorcycle now has a functional headlamp and all vehicles have night vision (operated by the flashlight hotkey)
- Rifle has been replaced with the PB-variant of the G36K with functional iron sights and a x4 ACOG scope (switch between them by holding altfire and then pressing dualwield)
- Every shotgun can now fire slugs from PB as well (press dualwield to change ammotypes) along with added slug ammo pickups (green shells)
- Created purist-versions of the MP40, Buzzsaw, and the Doom64 Unmaker along with the three demon keys which will be dropped randomly by boss monsters
- Created shotgun-start and arcade-versions (reloading disabled) of each playerclass
- Added tar, purple, magenta, gold, and icewater brutaldoom-liquids for use in various popular megawads when loaded with the applicable compatibility patch Compatibility Patches
- Fully fleshed-out the friendly marines feature, there is now a rescuable marine for every weapon type that we have a playersprite made for
- The demon morph feature has been completed, you can perform every attack and fatality on other monsters that you have previously observed that monster performing (using altfire and kick keybinds)
- The DragonSlayer joke weapon has been removed but all previously cheat-only weapons and brutaldoom-specific monsters (Ancient Arachnotron, Volcabus, Belphegor, Juggernaut, Motherdemon) have a rare chance of spawning in place of their vanilla counterpart weapon or monster in any playthrough.

### Load-Order

- Doom.wad or Doom2.wad
- any map-only wads
- brutalv21.x.x.pk3
- music wads and any files that are not going to rewrite files already modified by the brutalv21.x.x.pk3 unless specificaly developed with the brutalv21 in-mind or else you risk conflicts and unforseen errors.
